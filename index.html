        <h1>Hello, I'm Chloe!</h1>
        <p class="text">
            I am a student at Portland State University studying Computer Science. I first started programming when I joined the robotics team my junior year of high school and grew very fond of programming that I decided to go to school for it! However, I am not
            just a student but an employee too and have been since my senior year of high school. I started out as a professional popcorn scooper at Regal Evergreen theater and have worked my way up to a receptionist at Acumed. These experiences taught
            me hard work ethics that I brought with me into my first job in my desired career path as a tutor for the CS lab at PSU. Now, I currently intern in the PCEP program and I've worked at NWEA and Springbrook. All of these work experiences have
            taught me very valuable lessons and at times I feel I am living my life at a full sprint. I'm very thankful for my family and friends for being my pillars and I'm grateful for the opportunities I've had and eager to experience more!

            When studying object-oriented programming in one of my classes, I wrote a collection of card games in c++ for users to play. Group up with a team of people and verse each other in blackjack, slap jack, or guess the card! Navigate through .menus and play
            a textbase game. You can view the leaderboard by viewing all displaying the players, remove players when they start crushing you, add and remove games to the queue to play, and lastly but most importantly play the games! Be wary of the segfaults
            you might encounter and good luck playing the games because I never added instructions.

            A group and I got together for the WiCS hackathon and created a discord bot in a weekend! We combined the Steam API and Discord API to peak at your Steam library and share the games you and your friends have in common to find games to play together. In
            order to use the bot, you'll have to register and give your Steam username and you'll be on your way!

        <p>
            In high school, I joined my high school's robotics team that was a part of the FIRST Tech Challenge. Every year, we designed a robot to compete in the current year's challenge programming an autonomous and driver mode and creating mechanical components
            to launch wiffle balls, for example, or sensors to read color of a beacon. I worked on the programming team and worked on the autonomous mode of the robot so the robot could perform tasks by itself. One of the programs that I worked on navigated
            to a white line on the field, followed the line, and sensed the color of the beacon and pushed the corresponding color for the team we were on.
